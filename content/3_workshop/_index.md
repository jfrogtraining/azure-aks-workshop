In this workshop, we will demonstrate DevOps in the cloud with Azure and JFrog. We will build and deploy a Docker application. Using the JFrog Platform (Pipelines, Artifactory and Xray), we will execute a docker build and push, security scan the image and publish it to a repository. We will then deploy the image and serve the application with Azure AKS.
